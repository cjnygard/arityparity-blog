#### Technical Principal @Thoughtworks

Complex Systems | Infrastructure | Data / Analytics

I like building things and am a creative at heart.  I hold great admiration for the way the parts of complex systems work together.

In a professional capacity, I help companies achieve success through pragmatic means.  Most of the time this involves convincing organizational, people, and technological constructs to work together and filling in the gaps along the way.

In addition to leading software engineering and architecture projects for established companies, I've gone to the mat as a technical co-founder for two tech startups along the way.  Those experiences taught me a tremendous amount about what is really in the nuts and bolts of being successful commercially.  I bear the scars of bringing new products rapidly to market.  Chief among these, realizing the sense of how critical relationships and partnerships are to success in any endeavor.

I derive deep satisfaction working with my hands, and software is not my only creative medium.  I'm fascinated with automobiles, architecture, and manufacturing - other complex physical systems that have mechanical limitations to contend with like friction, mass, force, and space.  I find myself frequently drawing parallels while being actively engaged in both realms and write about my experiences in each - sometimes mixing in a little of each!
