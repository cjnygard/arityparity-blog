Full stack development and system design focused application of machine learning techniques to product development for consumer web services.
I have over ten years experience developing APIs and interfaces for services to effectively communicate and integrate.

I am motivated to help startup companies take pragmatic approaches to developing taste / preference graphs for their markets.

I've successfully failed at blogging multiple times and have co-founded two technology startups developing taste / preference profile extraction technology.
More importantly, I have experienced first hand the struggle of bringing new products rapidly to market and developing those crucial first relationships and partnerships.
