#### Technology Leader | Consultant | Architect | Developer | Engineer

I am a senior technology leader who self-identifies as a software engineer and architect.
I have 15+ years experience delivering mission-critical software systems to Fortune 10 and Governmental institutions in hands-on Software Engineer, Architect and Director-level management roles.
I am comfortable driving high-level strategic decisions and have the technical experience to understand how tactical decisions will affect the overall long-term strategic goals.

Someone I greatly respect once said that software is the medium within which their artistic creativity is expressed.
It is that expression of creativity that I seek out in the work that I do.
I mentor and motivate teams to achieve their own creativity in the software and solutions they deliver to meet their usersâ€™ needs and expectations.

I love solving problems and making things a little better every day.
