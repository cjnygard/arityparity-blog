I hold great admiration for the way the parts of complex systems work together.</p>\n<p>In a professional capacity, I help companies achieve success through pragmatic means.  Most of the time this involves convincing organizational, people, and technological constructs to work together and filling in the gaps along the way.</p>\n<p>In addition to leading software engineering and architecture projects for established companies, I’ve gone to the mat as a technical co-founder for two tech startups along the way.  Those experiences taught me a tremendous amount about what is really in the nuts and bolts of being successful commercially.  I bear the scars of bringing new products rapidly to market.  Chief among these, realizing the sense of how critical relationships and partnerships are to success in any endeavor.</p>\n<p>I derive deep satisfaction working with my hands, and software is not my only creative medium.  I’m fascinated with automobiles, architecture, and manufacturing - other complex physical systems that have mechanical limitations to contend with like friction, mass, force, and space.  I find myself frequently drawing parallels while being actively engaged in both realms and write about my experiences in each - sometimes mixing in a little of each!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daniel Kunnath","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/software-development-media.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about-dkunnath/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","79773751"]}
